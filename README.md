--------

#### Building mlo-gui ####

mlo-gui should be built on mlo-net envionment because mlo-gui has the 
dependency on mlo-srv in mlo-net.

**After executing install.sh in mlo-net**, mlo-gui can be built with
the following commands.
```
$ cd /home/developer/
$ git clone https://github.com/o3project/mlo-gui.git
$ cd mlo-gui/
$ ./build.sh
...

$ 
```

If successfully built, binary files will be zipped to the following 
path.

 /home/developer/mlo-gui/mlo-client/target/mlo-client-1.0-bin.zip.

#### Transfering and launching mlo-gui ####

mlo-gui can be launched in the following steps.

1. Transfers *mlo-client-1.0-bin.zip* to Windows PC via SCP and so on, and then unzips it.
2. Double-clicks *mlo-client-start.bat* including in the unzipped directory.
